## Introduction

This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using a CNN architecture. The model is designed to extract features from images and make predictions based on these features.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset with images categorized into `train` and `validation` directories.
2. Configure the paths for your training and validation datasets.
3. Execute the script to train the model.

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of:

- Several convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers.
- A flattening layer to convert the 2D matrix into a 1D vector.
- Fully connected layers for classification.

This architecture allows the model to learn hierarchical features from the images.

## Data Augmentation

Data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the diversity of the training dataset, including:

- Rescaling pixel values
- Rotation
- Width and height shifts
- Shearing and zooming
- Horizontal flips

## Training Process

The model is compiled using the `binary_crossentropy` loss function and the `RMSprop` optimizer. It is then trained for a specified number of epochs, using the training and validation datasets.

## Results Visualization

Training and validation losses and accuracies are plotted to visualize the model's performance over the epochs.
